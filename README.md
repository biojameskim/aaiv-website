## Who We Are

Asian American InterVarsity (AAIV) is a Christian Fellowship at Cornell University. We seek to share the incredible life that is found in God with those who identify with an Asian American background as well as serve the overall community at Cornell. However, you don’t have to be Asian American or Christian to be a part of AAIV or to come to any of our events! We’d love to meet you no matter what your background!

## Our Vision

The vision of InterVarsity is to see students and faculty transformed, campuses renewed, and world changers developed. We seek to align this purpose and vision with the unique environment at Cornell.
